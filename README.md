#  Handwritten Digit Classification with Neural Networks 

Welcome to the **Handwritten Digit Classification** project! This project shows how to classify handwritten digits using a deep learning Neural Network model and provides a basic yet intuitive **GUI** for drawing digits and classifying them in real time. 

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced machine learning enthusiast, this project will allow you to discover neural networks in a fun and engaging manner.

##  Features

- **Deep Learning Power**: A neural network trained on the popular **MNIST dataset** for digit recognition.
- **Interactive GUI**: Draw digits on the canvas and get instant predictions.
- **Customizable**: Train the model with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance.

---

##  Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

- `tensorflow` 
- `keras` 
- `numpy` 
- `matplotlib` 
- `tkinter` (for the GUI interface) 

You can install these dependencies using the command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

**Note:** `tkinter` is usually included with Python but verify its installation depending on your system.

##  Project Structure

Here's a quick overview of the project's core files:

- `handwritten-digit-recognition-using-NN.ipynb` - Contains the model training and evaluation code.
- `gui.py` - The Python script for running the GUI interface.

---

##  Getting Started

### 1. **Train the Neural Network Model** 

Open the Jupyter notebook `handwritten-digit-recognition-using-NN.ipynb`. Inside, you'll find:

- Data loading and preprocessing steps
- Model architecture
- Training the model on the MNIST dataset
- Saving the trained model for future use

You can run this notebook interactively to train your own neural network for digit classification.

### 2. **Run the GUI Interface** 

After the model is trained and saved, you're ready to use the interactive GUI. Simply run the `gui.py` script:

```bash
python gui.py
```

##  How to Use the GUI

1. **Draw a Digit**: Use your mouse to draw any digit (0-9) on the canvas.
2. **Classify**: Click the **"Classify"** button, and the neural network will predict the drawn digit.
3. **Clear**: Want to try again? You can easily clear the canvas and redraw.

###  Example:

- Draw the number "3" on the canvas.
- Click **"Classify"**.
- The predicted result (e.g., `3`) will be displayed.

##  Model Performance

The neural network used in this project is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. By default, it achieves strong accuracy on the MNIST dataset. You can further improve performance by experimenting with different model architectures or tuning hyperparameters.

---

##  Future Improvements

Here's a few ideas to enhance the project:

- **Accuracy Optimization**: Improve the neural network performance by tweaking the model architecture.
- **More GUI Features**: Add options for erasing the canvas, undoing strokes, or enhancing the classification output.
